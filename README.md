# visualcreator
Visual Creator is a UI editor for Linux and Windows.

With Visual Creator, you can create GTK or Windows Forms interfaces, and, in the Linux version, even connect and edit your UI with Python code. Also, Visual Creator uses its own file format to work in GUI, that can be used both in GTK and Windows Forms (you can use the same file for Linux and Windows).

## Linux
On Linux, Tinkta it's built on GTK 4, Adwaita and Python. Is available as Snap, Flatpak and .deb, so it can be used in every Linux distribution. In Linux version, Visual Creator can also edit code files, so you can easily connect your app to Python code.

If you want to install it as a Snap (recommended), go to Releases and visit the link to Snapcraft. Also, you can directly use the Snap Store if you're in Ubuntu or if you installed it, or use GNOME Software if you enabled Snap support; or use the command line.

If you want to install it as Flatpak, go to Releases and download the .flatpak file. Open it using the Software application of your distro. Please note that Visual Cretor is not available on Flathub, so you'll can't install it directly through Software.

If you want to install it as a traditional Debian application, go to Releases and download the .deb file. Open it using the Software application of your distro. Please note that .deb file will only work in Debian-based distributions, as Ubuntu, proper Debian, Linux Mint, elementary OS, Zorin, etc.

## Windows
On Windows, Visual Creator it's built on .NET Framework, Windows Forms and C#. Unfortunately, Windows version can't edit code and can only export and import .vcui files. We expect to include those features in upcoming versions.

To install, go to 'Releases' and download the latest .EXE file of the newer version. Execute the installer, and finally start using Tinkta.
